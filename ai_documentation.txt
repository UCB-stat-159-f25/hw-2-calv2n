Used DeepSeek for reminding me how to create a conda environment.

Prompt: "Remind me how to use conda to create a new environment, and include that environment's depenencies on one line. Then, how can I export the environment?"

Here's how to create and export a conda environment:
Create a new environment with dependencies on one line:
bash

conda create -n myenv python=3.9 numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter

Export the environment to a YAML file:
bash

conda env export > environment.yml

Additional useful commands:

Activate the environment:
bash

conda activate myenv

Create environment from a YAML file:
bash

conda env create -f environment.yml

Export without build numbers (for better cross-platform compatibility):
bash

conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

List all environments:
bash

conda env list

The environment.yml file will contain all the exact package versions and dependencies, making it easy to recreate the exact same environment later or share it with others.
